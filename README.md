# Effective Computing for Computational Biologists*

Effective Computing is about improving your skills and adopting Best
Practices to help make you a better programmer, *and a better
scientist.* This is a curated [short
list](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shortlist) of
resources to help you achieve these aims.

## General

+ [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org).

+ [Effective Computation in Physics](http://physics.codes).

+ [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons).

## Organizing, documenting and sharing, including version control

+ [Github](), [Bitbucket]() and [Gitlab]().

+ [An introduction to the basics of git and
Github](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668).

+ [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book).

+ [workflowr R package](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr).

+ Creating a "permanent resource" for your project:
[Zenodo](http://zenodo.org); [Data Dryad](http://datadryad.org).

## Programming and software design

+ [Software development is inherently
wicked.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/development-is-inherently-wicked)

## Plots and data visualization

+ It is important to [choose colors wisely](R-color.md) so that they are
visually distinguishable by most people.

## R

+ [R techniques for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

+ [Some advanced topics in R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz).

+ [Short guide to writing your own R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz).

## Best Practices

+ [Good Enough Practices in Scientific
Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037).

+ [Best Practices for Scientific
Computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).

+ Some more recommended practices:
[Noble, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424).

+ Licenses for open source projects:

programs](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10836).
