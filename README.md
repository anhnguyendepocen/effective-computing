# Effective Computing for Computational Biologists*

Effective Computing is about improving your skills and adopting Best
Practices to help make you a better programmer, *and a better
scientist.* This is a curated [short
list](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shortlist) of
resources to help you achieve these aims.

*We welcome community contributions.* If you have a suggestion or comment,
please post an
[Issue](https://github.com/stephenslab/effective-computing/issues).
